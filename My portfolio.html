            <p>
                Hi, My name is Momoh Abdulrasheed, I am the CEO of FiveStars Developaz, a tech company in Nigeria. 
                I am a self taught front-end developer. Aside fullstack development, I have an interest in 
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) with a particular focus on Machine Learning, Deep Learning, 
                Automation, Robotics and Data Science. At a personal level, I am a man of few words with a 
                reserved, dedicated, and open-minded personality. I like to mind my business in all the 
                things I do. I believe that a person should work on developing themselves with professional 
                skills by learning new things all the time. This has been my guiding principle and philosophy 
                through the years. 
            </p>
